# _Valheim ToDo_
Valheim ToDo is a small program that allows you to create a list of things to do, in the game Valheim. It has a full (I think) list of the items in the game and their resources. You can choose an amount of items an it will calculate the required resources, or you can just put in notes to do. This list can then be overlayed over the top of the game for easy reference or anyone that only has 1 monitor.

### Initial release // Features
I banged this out over the weekend and ran out of time to add all the features that I wanted to. Currently you can:
- add any item from the game, it will automatically add the parts it needs to build it as sub items
- overlay the list on the game
- tick off an item to remove it from the overlay (including sub items)
- change the overlay colour
- change individual item colour (although not edit after choosing)
- switch screen that its displayed on (for all those heathens that don't play on their primary monitor)
- press delete on the keyboard to remove individual selected (or multiple selected items)

### Possible features
- User offset for Overlay (ability to change location of the overlay)
- Change amount after adding to recalculate sub items
- Right click an item to edit
- Customisable overlay size (currently a static window for formatting reasons)
- Better formatting
- Save/Load specific lists (currently only a local/application save and load on startup)
- and more..

### How to Use // Screenshots
The Application itself is fairly simple to use:
1. Choose or type in an item you want to add, you could also make it a task such as "Kill some greydwarves", it just can't be an empty field.
2. If you want a different amount other than the default 1, change that.
3. Set a location on your task if you wish, this field can be empty.
4. Choose your overlay colour, default is Lime Green (basically neon) as it stands out well.
5. And click add - this will add it to the list of items.
6. You can then click the Toggle Overlay button to turn the overlay, and launch up valhiem
7. If the overlay is on the wrong screen, hit the switch screens button.

When you're done with tasks:
- Tick items you want to want to remove from the overlay but keep in the list (like repeating tasks)
- Hit delete key with to delete selected items from the list.
- Hit the clear all items button to remove all items.
